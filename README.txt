Hi, dear programmer!

Welcome to my new work-in-progress project where I will be coding in C++ a survival old-school style game.

At the moment, it is not working properly since I am the only developer behind the source code you can find in this repository,
and there are too many things to do yet...

However, please, do not hesitate to support this project by modifing and improving the source code. I will be very grateful. Also,
do not forget to mention me if you use any of the source code I publish here.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Henry
