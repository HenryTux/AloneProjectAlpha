Alone will be a standalone survival old-school style game where the player will have to survive 
for as long as possible without being eaten by the undead that populate a desolate Earth,
gathering weapons and resources to stay safe and sound from the zombies.

Actually, the game is under development. However, while an Alpha Version is released, you can try
our demo 'Zombie Combat Simulator', where you are invited to test your skills when fighting tought
and deadly zombies.

Donations are accepted as well as the developers who would like to join the dev team of Alone. 
Please, do not hesitate to report any bugs or issues you encounter while playing this pre-Alpha, 
and also, support the game making us know your suggestions to improve it.

Hope you enjoy it!
